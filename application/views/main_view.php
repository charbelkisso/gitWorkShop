		<P>We see this challenge as a whole project software engineering project, so we chose a path that proved to be a bit of a challenge to all the team members. That has driven us to make most of this decisions based on this.

We have used the LAMP software setup. Our reasons for this is that it is a widely known software, so it is manageable for beginners. It also offers a lot of help for troubleshooting and there is a lot of information to get it to work as we want.
When thinking what software to use, we needed something that beginners will catch up soon, but also challenging for the team members that were already familiar with web programming. This made the LAMP the perfect candidate for us as a team.

To make it a bit more exciting for the ones who already knew about this subject, we decided to develop the website with a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. This would allow us to work in a modular aspect, with each of us learning about the module we knew least of.

In order to process HTTP requests, we have used Apache 2, which is a tool that helps us to manage the correct display of our dynamic web page.

To storage our data, we implemented MySQL, as it is compatible with our view of the project, and it also offers DBMS to visually manage the data. As it is related to php, there weren't too many new things to grab for the newbies.

To set up the server we decided to use DigitalOcean with the hardware setup that was most suitable to our project, since we wanted just one simple page and we do not expect so many visitors, we chose 512MB RAM and 20Gb HDD capacity.
We didn’t create a key, just use the regular username and password login over ssh, as we thought it would be more convenient to share the files and install a virtual server on our own computers to work before going online.
SFTP for file transfer.

As for the advantages of this setup, we found that is a cheap server provider, with a lot of manuals to begin with, and to do some troubleshooting. It also lets us setup whichever software we like. As disadvantages, we will have low storage and low RAM capacity. And another con would be that we are free to install whichever software we want, so as beginners, we can make some mistakes in this aspect.

Yeah, we chose LAMP because the logos are cute. Who doesn’t want their page run by a penguin who is friends with a dolphin?


Team work!
As a team, we decided to have a team manager, as one of us had more experience with web developing and all agreed that will be best for this particular assignment.
